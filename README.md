## Project Overivew
A young entrepreneur is pitching the concept of a surf and ice cream shop business located on the beach in Oahu, Hawaii to an investor.  Before he will fully commit, the investor wants to see more information and analysis on the temperature trends for the months of June and December in order to determine if the Oahu weather will sustainably support a surf and ice cream shop business all year round.  The purpose of this project is to conduct the analysis for June and December temperatures in Oahu and provide the information.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
-  Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, 
- Applications: SQLAlchemy, SQLite

## Results
- The biggest difference between June and December weather in Oahu is the minimum temperature: June's minimum is 64 while December's minimum is 56.
- The maximum temperatures are very similar: June's maximum is 85 while December's maximum is 83.
- The average temperatures are ver close too: June's average temperature is 75 (rounded up from 74.9) while December's average is 71.

## Summary
- Overall, the temperatures are favorable for surf and ice cream in June and stay relatively constant through the winter in December to where the conditions remain conducive to surfing and eating ice cream.  All metrics are within 4 of each other, with the exception of the minimum temperature, which is lower by only 8 degrees December.  People who travel to Oahu in December will likely be escaping the harsh cold winters where they live and will enjoy the December temperatures, surf, and ice cream of Oahu.

Some potential additional queries:
- Number of days of sunshine within June and December
- Number of days of good surf based on the tide data
- Number of days of high winds
